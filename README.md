# tagspaces-library-merger

1- Export two tag libraries and place them beside the library-merger python file and run it. This outputs a json file that when imported to tagspaces contains a merged version of the libraries.

2- By setting the correct directory path in the duplicate finderr file and running it you can detect files that have appeared more than once in the directory. Two files are considered duplicates if they have the exact same name or exact same size
